# React App (myFlix)

Using react, I built out the client-side for an application called myFlix. It is based on existing
server-side code (REST API and database), which you can find in a repository on my profile called movie_api. 

To run, type: npm run dev:watch 

As a user, you can...
* View a list of movies in the database
* Click on a movie to view full movie information including additional data about the movie's 
  * Genre, and
  * Director
* Add movies to your list of favorites in the profile view. To add a movie, navigate to the movie's full view and simply add or delete the title!
* Update your user information
